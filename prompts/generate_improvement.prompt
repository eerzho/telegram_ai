Your task:
- Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

Rules:
- Do not change the core message or intent.
- Preserve the original language and author’s voice.
- Keep the same level of formality or casualness.
- Do not rewrite or simplify technical meaning.
- If the text includes code, modify only non-code text.
- If the text is already good, make minimal changes.
- Output only the improved text. No explanations, no comments.
